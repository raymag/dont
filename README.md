# Nope
Browser Extension for blocking domains in order to keep focused in other tasks.

With Nope you can easily add website domains you find distractive to a blocklist, then when you need to be focused, all you need to do is to enable Nope. This way, whenever you try to access a domain from the block list, Nope will automatically block it for you.
